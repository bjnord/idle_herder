# Idle Herder

To see Idle Herder in action, visit the [web application](https://github.com/bjnord/idle_herder).

Idle Herder aims to help you manage your heroes and resources in [Idle Heroes](https://www.facebook.com/Idleheroes/). If you’re a new player trying to learn the hero fusion tree, or a more advanced player who wants to plan the materials needed to make better heroes, this app is for you!

Idle Herder complements the wealth of information found at the [Idle Heroes Wiki](http://idleheroes.wikia.com/wiki/IdleHeroes_Wiki) by providing a way to _track your own_ heroes, shards, and other resources, as well as tracking your _goals and priorities_ and what materials you already have and still need to achieve them.

The idea for Idle Herder came from the [PADherder app](https://www.padherder.com/) for [Puzzle & Dragons](http://www.gunghoonline.com/games/puzzle-dragons/). PAD is a fun game, if you haven’t tried it… and PADherder helps a lot!
